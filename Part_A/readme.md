## Part A by [Prof. Raul Santaeulalia](http://r-santaeulalia.net/Quantitative-Macro-F18-UnitI.html)

This part of repository uploaded rough Problem Sets Solutions.

Most of my work was on MATLAB, since I could get deeper understanding when coding on MATLAB, whereas for Python,
[QuantEcon](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index.html) has already developed many packages (i.e. various VFI)

Guideline:

PS1: multivariate and univariate approximation methods, such as Chebyshev polynomials;  

PS2: different measure of Labor Share in US, UK, and Japan;

PS3:
- compute different set-up in an infinite periods of Representative Agent economy;
- (Root-finding Algorithm) 2-period Heterogeneous Agent economy with different initial wealth and productivity shocks. ( In the HA, we are required to compute GE, hence, need an interest rate to clear the asset market.)

PS4 is Value Function Iteration in both Deterministic and Stochastic Growth Model.
- updated: added Tax part.

PS5(final project): 
- A simple consumption and saving model with 2-state transition income matrix and natural borrowing constraint. (Partial Equilibrium)
- Solve the ABHI Model in various cases. (General Equilibrium)
