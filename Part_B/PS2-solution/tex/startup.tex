\begin{abstract}
	Quantitative Macroeconomics (Part 2) Problem Set 2

	I`m doing this problem set into 2 parts:

        Part 1: Question 1 for solving Aiyagari model with endogenous labor supply (the case without aggregate risk), I use two different methods: endogenous grid methods with interpolation nodes, and Sample codes from PS1 with brute-force VFI plus some modifications.
