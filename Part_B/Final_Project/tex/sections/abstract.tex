\indent Since the distribution of agents is an infinite dimension object (many state variables), one method is approximating the distribution using only few moments, i.e. Krusell\&Smith simulation, etc. And others such as using a perturbation method are more popular recently, i.e. LeGrand-Ragot who truncates the history of idiosyncratic shock; Reiter who solves the individual problem with a projection method, and approximate the law of motion of aggregate variables and the distribution with a perturbation method.

Thus, I'm going to learn about such methods and try to implement them on Krusell\&Smith Model.
