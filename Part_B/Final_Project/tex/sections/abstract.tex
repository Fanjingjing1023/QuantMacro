\indent Since the distribution of agents is an infinite dimension object (many state variables), one method is approximating the distribution using only few moments, i.e. Krusell\&Smith simulation, etc. And others such as using a perturbation method are more popular recently, i.e. Reiter methods. Den Haan, Wouter (2010)\cite{den2010comparison} make very complete comparisons about different algorithm on solving KS model. In my final project, the main target is to learn about Reiter methods and try to implement them on Krusell\&Smith Model.
