### Final Project Summary: 

#### Comparison of different solution methods on solving Krusell&Smith Model with Heterogeneous Agents.

- For abbreviation, also say: different solution methods on solving DSGE with Heterogeneous Agents.

Since the distribution of agents is an infinite dimension object (many state variables), one method is approximating the distribution using only few moments, i.e. Krusell&Smith simulation, etc. And others such as using a perturbation method are more popular recently, i.e. LeGrand-Ragot who truncates the history of idiosyncratic shock; Reiter who solves the individual problem with a projection method, and approximate the law of motion of aggregate variables and the distribution with a perturbation method.

I'm going to compare the following different solution methods:

**0. Approximate distribution using a few moments (Krusell and Smith Algorithm)**

**1. Perturbation ([LeGrand and Ragot](http://www.wouterdenhaan.com/teach/legrandragot.pdf))**

**2. Projection + Perturbation (Reiter)**
