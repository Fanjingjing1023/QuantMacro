# Quantitative Macroeconomics, 2018-2019

## Economics PhD 2nd Year Course, UAB

### Intro
Our course is separated into two parts.
Part A is from basic numerical methods to
solution of Representative Agent Models (permanent income, life-cycle) with VFI, PFI;
and eventually going to Heterogenous Agents with Incomplete Markets.
In the end, we need to solve Recursive Stationary Equilibrium of the Aiyagari-Bewley-Hugget-Imrohoroglu (ABHI) Model.

Part B accesses to Krusell and Smith (1998) model (Heterogenous agents, incomplete markets and aggregate uncertainty), and defaultable sovereign debt.
