This repository is for uploading Problem Sets Solutions.
PS1 is about approximation methods, such as Chebyshev polynomials;  
PS2 is about constructing different measure of Labor Share in US, UK, and Japan;
PS3:
- compute different set-up in an infinite periods of Representative Agent economy;
- 2-period Heterogeneous Agent economy with different initial wealth and productivity shocks. ( In the HA, we are required to compute GE, hence, need an interest rate to clear the asset market.)
PS4 is Value Function Iteration in both Deterministic and Stochastic Growth Model.
- updated: added Tax part.
PS5 is our final project, expected to upload a first version before 1 Nov, 2018.
