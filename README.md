# Quantitative Macroeconomics

## Economics PhD 2nd Year Course at UAB, taught by Prof. Raul Santaeulalia:
[2018-2019 Quantitative Macroeconomic](http://r-santaeulalia.net/Quantitative-Macro-F18-UnitI.html)

This repository is for uploading Problem Sets Solutions.

Most of my work was on MATLAB, since I could get deeper understanding when coding on MATLAB, whereas for Python,
[QuantEcon](https://lectures.quantecon.org/py/index.html) has already developed many packages (i.e. various VFI)

PS1 is about approximation methods, such as Chebyshev polynomials;  

PS2 is about constructing different measure of Labor Share in US, UK, and Japan;

PS3:
- compute different set-up in an infinite periods of Representative Agent economy;
- 2-period Heterogeneous Agent economy with different initial wealth and productivity shocks. ( In the HA, we are required to compute GE, hence, need an interest rate to clear the asset market.)

PS4 is Value Function Iteration in both Deterministic and Stochastic Growth Model.
- updated: added Tax part.

PS5 is our final project, I uploaded a first version on 1 Nov, 2018. Expected to finish before January, 2019.
